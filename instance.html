        <p>Please read our definition of apt paraphrases and literal language in the detailed instructions carefully and complete the quiz below before answering the rating questions.</p>
        <p><strong>This HIT will be quality-controlled.</strong> Not completing the quiz will lead to exclusion from further HITs. A low score of the quiz will lead to direct rejection of your assignments. You only have to do this <em>once</em>.</p>
        <h2>Quiz 1</h2>
        <p>Select <em>all</em> of the statements below that are true according to our definition of aptness and literalness:
        <ol>
          <li><crowd-checkbox name="diff_quiz" value="if_apt_then_lit">An apt paraphrase is also a literal paraphrase.</crowd-checkbox></li>
          <li><crowd-checkbox name="diff_quiz" value="if_lit_then_apt">A paraphrase that only uses literal language is also an apt paraphrase.</crowd-checkbox></li>
          <li><crowd-checkbox name="diff_quiz" value="separate">Apt paraphrases do not necessarily use literal language.</crowd-checkbox></li>
          <li><crowd-checkbox name="diff_quiz" value="if_nonlit_then_inapt">If a paraphrase uses non-literal language, it should be considered an inapt paraphrase.</crowd-checkbox></li>
          <li><crowd-checkbox name="diff_quiz" value="intuitive_lit_rating">You are encouraged to use your intuition to rate the literalness of the given texts.</crowd-checkbox></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Quiz 2</h2>
        <p>Select <em>all</em> of the sentences below that only use literal language:<ol>

        <h2>Apt paraphrases</h2>
        <p>A candidate paraphrase is an apt paraphrase of the original text if the message it conveys is the same or similar to the original text. Please use your intuition to answer the question about the aptness of the candidate paraphrase; there are no right or wrong answers. However, we may ask you to explain your rating if it deviates greatly from the majority.</p>

        <h2>Literal language</h2>
        <p>A sentence uses literal language if it conveys meaning directly, describing an object or an event as it is, and using words that are typically associated with the object or event. Literal language constrasts with figurative language, which can take the form of metaphor, personification, simile, idiom, pun, hyperbole, etc.</p>
        <p>Please consider the literalness and aptness of a paraphrase as separate criteria. A candidate paraphrase can fully capture the meaning of the original text and thus counts as an apt paraphrase, but does so via the use of non-literal language. Similarly, a paraphrase may use literal language entirely but fail to capture an important aspect of meaning of the original text.</p>

    <div class="eg">
      <p>Examples of literal sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have to go to my country to see my father.</li>
        <li>Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated.</li>
        <li>The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of non-literal sentences:</p>
      <ul id="nonlit_egs">
        <li>And tell me, <span class="mrw">sweet</span> creature, do you <span class="mrw">count</span> as a <span class="mrw">toy</span>?<br /><span class="explain_met">This sentence addresses a person, describing the person as <q>sweet</q> and comparing the person to <q>a toy</q>. The basic meaning of <u>sweet</u> is to describe a sugary taste; its usage in this sentence thus compares the person to things that typically taste sweet, such as sugar. Similarly, as people are not toys, the comparison between the person and toys is non-literal. The usage of <u>count</u> is also non-literal, as it refers to an abstract thinking process of considering whether a person belongs to a particular category, whereas the word has a more concrete meaning of calculating the number of objects.</span></li>
        <li>No longer can the Government <span class="mrw">disguise</span> the crisis <span class="mrw">surrounding</span> electricity privatisation.<br /><span class="explain_met">Both <u>disguise</u> and <u>surround</u> have a more concrete meaning than their meaning in this sentence.</span></li>
        <li>I wouldn't want her to have a <span class="mrw">rough</span> time.<br /><span class="explain_met"><u>Rough</u> refers to the texture of a surface, how the surface of something feels against your skin. Time apparently does not have a surface for us to touch; the usage is therefore non-literal.</span></li>
      </ul>
