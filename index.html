  <h1>Full instructions for our rating task</h1>
  <p>In this task, you are presented with two pieces of text. Your task is to rate the two texts in terms of (1) whether they have the same meaning, and (2) whether they use literal language.</p>
        <h2>Same meaning</h2>
        <p>Please use your intuition to decide whether the given texts have the same meaning; there are no right or wrong answers. However, we may ask you to explain your rating if it deviates greatly from the majority.</p>

        <h2>Literal language</h2>
        <p>A sentence uses literal language if it conveys meaning directly, describing an object or an event as it is, and using words that are typically associated with the object or event. Literal language constrasts with figurative language, which can take the form of metaphor, personification, simile, idiom, pun, hyperbole, etc.</p>

    <div class="eg">
      <p>Examples of literal sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have to go to my country to see my father.</li>
        <li>Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated.</li>
        <li>The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of non-literal sentences:</p>
      <ul id="nonlit_egs">
        <li>And tell me, <span class="mrw">sweet</span> creature, do you <span class="mrw">count</span> as a <span class="mrw">toy</span>?
          <ul class="explain_met">
            <li><u>Sweet</u> refers to a sugary taste. As it is unlikely that the person being referred to as <q>sweet creature</q> has a sugary taste, the usage is non-literal.</li>
            <li>People are not toys, so the comparison between the person and toys is also non-literal.</li>
            <li><u>Count</u> refers to an abstract thinking process in this sentence, of considering whether a person belongs to a particular category. As the word has a more concrete meaning of calculating the number of objects, its usage here is non-literal.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>No longer can the Government <span class="mrw">disguise</span> the crisis <span class="mrw">surrounding</span> electricity privatisation.<br /><span class="explain_met">Both <u>disguise</u> and <u>surround</u> have a more concrete meaning than their meaning in this sentence.</span></li>
        <li>I wouldn't want her to have a <span class="mrw">rough</span> time.<br /><span class="explain_met"><u>Rough</u> refers to the texture of a surface, how the surface of something feels against your skin. Time apparently does not have a surface for us to touch; the usage is therefore non-literal.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<p>That's it! Thanks for your time!</p>
